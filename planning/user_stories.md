## Non-authenticated user stories

- As a non-authenticated user, I can see a list of the available maps, because I don't want to make an account to see maps.

- As a non-authenticated user, I can select a map from the list of available maps, because I want to see more details about the points of interest on the map.

- As a non-authenticated user, I can see the details of each point of interest, because I want to determine if it is interesting to me.
