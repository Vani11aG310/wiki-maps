Please create an insert query that will insert 30 maps using the following shape.

userid_id is a number between 1 an 3.
title is the name of the map.  The map name is a list of a favourite places, restaurants, or things to do in a Canadian city.
address is the address of the area the map is covering.
description is short description of the map.  It should not exceed 50 characters.
photo_url is a link to https://picsum.photos/id/<id>/1024/768'. Replace <id> with a sequence number starting at 1.

INSERT INTO maps 
(user_id, title, address, description, photo_url) 
VALUES
(1, 'Victoria Landmarks', 'Victoria British Columbia', 'Favorite spots in Victoria.', 'https://picsum.photos/id/1/200/300');


Now, based on the previous query, I need to add 4 places to each map using the following shape.
map_id is the row number from the previous query.
title is the name of the place, landmark, or 
latitude and longitude for the geo location of the place
description is description of the place.  It should not exceed 100 characters.
photo_url is a link to https://picsum.photos/id/<id>/1024/768'. Replace <id> with a sequence number starting at 101.

INSERT INTO places
(map_id, title, latitude, longitude, description, photo_url)
VALUES
(1, 'Terry Fox Statue', 48.409678184982575, -123.36896467287193, 'The Terry Fox statue is a bronze sculpture that was installed in the park in 2000 near the Mile Zero monument.', 'https://picsum.photos/id/101/1024/768');
